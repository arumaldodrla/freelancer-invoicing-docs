# UX, Copy, & Trust

This document provides guidelines for the user experience (UX), copy, and trust-building measures for the Freelancer Invoicing & Gig Income Tracking application.

## 1. Voice & Tone Guidelines

- **Empathetic & Encouraging:** The application should use a supportive and encouraging tone to help users feel confident about managing their finances.
- **Clear & Simple:** Avoid jargon and technical terms. Use clear and simple language that is easy for everyone to understand.
- **Trustworthy & Professional:** The application should project a sense of professionalism and trustworthiness to assure users that their data is safe and secure.

## 2. Trust Surfaces

- **Privacy & Security Assurances:** Display privacy and security assurances throughout the application, especially during onboarding and when asking for sensitive information.
- **Clear & Transparent Pricing:** Be upfront and transparent about pricing. There should be no hidden fees or surprises.
- **Social Proof:** Display testimonials and reviews from other freelancers to build trust and credibility.

## 3. Tax Estimate Disclaimers

All tax estimates should be accompanied by a clear disclaimer that they are for informational purposes only and not financial advice. Users should be advised to consult with a tax professional for personalized advice.

## 4. Sync Transparency

Be transparent about how and when the application syncs with external platforms. Provide users with clear feedback on the status of their syncs and notify them of any errors.

## 5. Error Message Patterns

All error messages should be friendly, helpful, and actionable. They should explain what went wrong in simple terms and provide a clear next step for the user.

## 6. AI Support Escalation Messaging

When the AI support agent is unable to resolve an issue, it should offer to create a support ticket with a human agent. The messaging should be seamless and reassuring, letting the user know that their issue will be handled by a human.

## 7. "No Zoho Portals" UX Requirement

All customer-facing interactions, including subscription management and billing, will be handled within the application's UI. Users should not be redirected to Zoho's portals for any reason. This is a critical requirement to ensure a seamless and consistent user experience.
